Recognizing Digits with Kubeflow
=====================================
MLOps Workflow Demo

The [MNIST database of handwritten digits](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) is the Hello-World of deep learning and therefore the best example to focus not on the ML model itself, but on creating the ML pipeline. The goal here is to create an automated ML pipeline for getting the data, data pre-processing, and creating and serving the ML model. You can see an overview of the digits recognizer application below.
